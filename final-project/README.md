<h1>Yiwi</h1>

Yiwi is a website to help Chinese learners keep all of their learned characters, words and sentences in one place, divided by lists. It was inspired by my own struggles as a Chinese learner to keep track of all new characters and structures I learned in one place, divided by areas of interest. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEDg8vIp118">Watch the video.</a>

It has 3 main functionalities:
1. <b>Lists</b>: create as many lists as you wish to organize all entries;
